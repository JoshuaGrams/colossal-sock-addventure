# Collaborative Colossal Sock Addventure

This is the main repo of the Collaborative Colossal Sock Addventure, a game started for ECTOCOMP 2023.

## What is this about ?

The idea of the Colossal Sock Adventure sprouted in the mind of Pinkunz on the Neo-Interactive discord.  
Then smwhr went a little heavy on the liquor a few days later and vowed to make something from this idea during [ECTOCOMP](https://itch.io/jam/ectocomp-2023-english).

It starts like this :
> Long ago, socks and underwear were the best of friends, coexisting peacefully in the realm of Laundrandia. They worked together to keep humans comfortable and stylish. However, a rivalry emerged over time due to differences in their roles. Underwear, more known for their practicality and occasional great personal sacrifice, grew envious of the spotlight that socks received due to their colorful designs and various styles as well as being regularly seen and admired by other humans.

Okay now, to the cool part : it's an <em>Add</em>venture. Meaning that you are welcome to _add_ things to the story. To make it colossal. I don't have the stamina to make it colossal on my own. I have two toddlers you know. And it's fall, we're all sick and cold. Help me make it colossal. _Pleaaaase_.

## How can I participate ?

Glad you asked the question, I almost waited.  
The CCSA is a dendry game. If you've never written for dendry yet, you're in luck because [there's a tutorial](https://smwhr.notion.site/Getting-started-with-Dendry-188e7e39a961497fb2d0a0deee0c21a0) just for you !  
Dendry is perfectly suited to an addventure because each scene is self-contained, describe how/when it can happen, and can declare tags so that other scenes can "attach" to it.   
I'll link to an example as soon as I write one. Stay tuned. (If you're a dendry wiz, do not hesitate to do it before me, I won't be jealous (pretty much the opposite)).

> The Socksmith, a wise and ancient being formed from primordial dryer lint, emerged as a peacemaker. Crafted from the threads of unity, the Socksmith created a special sock capable of bestowing the gift of reconciliation on those who possessed it, aiming to bridge the gap between socks and underwear. This magical sock, known as the "Harmony Sock," could adapt its appearance and qualities based on its surroundings.

## I mean, in concrete terms, how can I participate ?

One sec, I'm coming to it.  
First, fork this repository. (little button near the top of the page)  
If you want to work directly in the browser you can follow [this part of the abovementionned tutorial](https://smwhr.notion.site/Use-the-Dendry-Starter-Pack-17699e255fc445a193555b65b3b566fd).  
Create a new folder in `source` with your name in tech-case (meaning no space or special characters please).  
Create your _qualities_ and _scenes_ as you want.  
When you're satisfied, [open a pull request](https://github.com/smwhr/colossal-sock-addventure/compare) so that you code can be _merged_ with the main code.  

> The Socksmith, saddened by such senseless fabric-shed, retreated into self-exile, leaving the socks and underwear to their grievances.
> In the midst of the divide, the discord caused ancient evil to emerge. Detergent monsters arose from the negativity fueled by the rivalry. 

## Looks cool, but still pretty obscure...

If you have questions or want help, come talk to me (smwhr) on the [Neo-Interactives Discord](https://discord.gg/7snAkQxXZf) and I'll probably make a thread on intfiction too.


## Are you sure this is fit for ECTOCOMP ?

Well, I don't know about you, but _talking underwears in a never-ending cave_ spook the hell out of me.  
Anyway, you can add anything halloween themed (socks used for trick-or-threating ?), you can have the player wander in a multicoloured Sock de los Muertos parade, or fall in the 9th cycle of the washing machine.   
Mostly, don't forget to have fun.
